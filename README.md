# Microsoft-Hackathon-AI-Learning

### A 3rd place Hackathon winner Adaptify! An app for translating learning material into a more comprehensible way for neurodiverse learning based on behavioural science. A revolutionary educational platform that creates personalized learning experiences for neurodivergent learners through AI-driven customization.

## **Overview**
This repository contains the project developed during the Microsoft Hackathon, focusing on utilizing Artificial Intelligence to create personalized learning experiences for neurodiverse students. Our solution aims to address the challenges faced by neurodivergent learners in traditional educational systems by providing tailored study materials and an inclusive, interactive learning platform.

## **Problem Statement**
Neurodiverse students often face difficulties in traditional learning environments due to a "one-size-fits-all" approach. These challenges include:
- Lack of personalized learning experiences.
- Inadequate accessibility tools.
- Limited support for diverse learning preferences and needs.

Our goal is to create a solution that bridges these gaps by leveraging AI to provide customized and accessible educational tools.

## **Solution**
We developed a platform that uses a questionnaire-based approach to assess individual learning preferences and needs. Based on the responses, the platform generates a personalized, interactive study space designed to help users achieve their academic goals. Key features of our solution include:
- **Personalized Learning Plans**: Tailored strategies based on user preferences and neurodiversity profiles.
- **Accessibility Tools**: Features like visual aids, hands-on activities, and movement-based learning methods.
- **Interactive Environment**: An engaging platform that adapts to the user's unique learning style.

## **How It Works**
1. **Questionnaire**: Users complete a 20-question survey designed to identify their learning preferences and challenges.
2. **AI Processing**: The responses are processed using a Large Language Model (LLM) chain to generate personalized recommendations.
3. **Learning Strategies**: The platform provides tailored strategies such as written materials, visual aids, hands-on practice, or movement-based activities.
4. **Interactive Platform**: Users interact with a dynamic study space that supports their specific needs.

### Example Outputs:
- For a user with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD): Emphasis on written materials and visual aids while minimizing verbal explanations.
- For a Kinesthetic Learner: Hands-on experiments, trial-and-error approaches, and movement-based activities.

## **Features**
- **Neurodiversity Survey**: A comprehensive questionnaire to assess individual needs.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: LLM chains analyze survey responses to create tailored learning strategies.
- **Customizable Study Space**: A user-friendly interface that adapts to different learning styles.
